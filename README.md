# PandasLab


Dev10 `pandas` Lab group exercise

This repository documents the ETL (and later the analysis) part of the `pandas` lab.

Since the 1958 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been measuring CO${_2}$ levels at their Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. It is the longest record of direct measurements of CO${_2}$ in the atmoshere. The data has shown a clear trend in increased atmospheric CO${_2}$ since then.

While we are aware that there are natural sources of greenhouse gases, our group would like to investigate if this overall rising trend is correlated with greenhouse gases output from various contries collectively and individually.
